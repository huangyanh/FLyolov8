# FLyolov8-FLCSDet-Federated-Learning-Driven-Cross-Spatial-Vessel-Detection
We have developed a federated learning-driven maritime visual surveillance method for multi-agency coordinated surveillance of marine areas.


Server
In order to start a Federated Learning training, it is necessary to start the server:

python fd_server.py --config_file yolo_task.json --port 12345

- port: ip of the server
- config_file: parameters necessary for federated learning

Client
Clients must be created after the server. 
python fd_client1.py
